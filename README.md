## Overview
Alphabet Soup, a fictious non-profit fund raising company is trying to determine which canidates will be successful if funded. Using neural networks and a variety of techniques I attempt to create a Machine Learning module to find the best fit. The dataset contains 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years.
